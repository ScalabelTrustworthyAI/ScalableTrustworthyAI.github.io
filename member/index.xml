My research goal is to make machine learning more trustworthy by delivering uncertainty estimates along with each prediction. To this end, I&amp;rsquo;m developing probabilistic embeddings that represent a model&amp;rsquo;s uncertainty directly in its embedding space. I love to understand and prove things first from a mathematical perspective (paper) and then scale them to large datasets in practice (paper).</description></item><item><title>Group Leader</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/joon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/joon/</guid><description>My personal page is at seongjoonoh.com.
I am an independent group leader at the Tübingen AI Center at the University of Tübingen, where I lead the group on Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI). I am interested in training reliable models (e.g. explainable, robust, and probabilistic models) and obtaining the necessary human supervision and guidance in a cost-effective way.
I have been a research scientist at NAVER AI Lab for 3.5 years. I received my PhD in computer vision and machine learning at Max-Planck Institute for Informatics in 2018, under the supervision of Bernt Schiele and Mario Fritz.</description></item><item><title>PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/alex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/alex/</guid><description>I am a PhD Student at the Tübingen AI Center at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS), where I work in the group on Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI). I am interested in researching the ways of making models not only perfectly classify MNIST but also not fail too much on real world tasks. In case possibilities of some models are limited to academic datasets, I want to understand why that is the case.</description></item><item><title>PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/elif/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/elif/</guid><description>I am a first year PhD student in the Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI) group at the Tübingen AI Center.
I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science from University of Tübingen in 2022, and Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Saarland University in 2019. I am interested in understanding abstractions humans and neural networks perform in visual representations and how to use these to improve model robustness and Human-Computer Interaction.</description></item><item><title>PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/elisa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2016 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/elisa/</guid><description>My personal page is at elisanguyen.github.io.
I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS).
Before, I absolved my Master’s in Interaction Technology at the University of Twente and my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Management at the Nordakademie. I did my Bachelor studies in a dual study format in cooperation with Airbus, where I also worked for about 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
