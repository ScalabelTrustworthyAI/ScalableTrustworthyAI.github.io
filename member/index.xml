I am an independent group leader at the Tübingen AI Center at the University of Tübingen, where I lead the group on Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI). I am interested in training reliable models (e.g. explainable, robust, and probabilistic models) and obtaining the necessary human supervision and guidance in a cost-effective way.
I have been a research scientist at NAVER AI Lab for 3.5 years. I received my PhD in computer vision and machine learning at Max-Planck Institute for Informatics in 2018, under the supervision of Bernt Schiele and Mario Fritz.</description></item><item><title>PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/alex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/alex/</guid><description>I am a PhD Student at the Tübingen AI Center at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS), where I work in the group on Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI). I am interested in researching the ways of making models not only perfectly classify MNIST but also not fail too much on real world tasks. In case possibilities of some models are limited to academic datasets, I want to understand why that is the case.</description></item><item><title>PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/elisa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2016 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/elisa/</guid><description>My personal page is at elisanguyen.github.io.
I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS).
Before, I absolved my Master’s in Interaction Technology at the University of Twente and my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Management at the Nordakademie. I did my Bachelor studies in a dual study format in cooperation with Airbus, where I also worked for about 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
