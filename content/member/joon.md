My personal page is at [seongjoonoh.com](https://coallaoh.github.io/).

I am an independent group leader at the [Tübingen AI Center](https://tuebingen.ai/) at the University of Tübingen, where I lead the group on Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI). I am interested in training reliable models (e.g. explainable, robust, and probabilistic models) and obtaining the necessary human supervision and guidance in a cost-effective way.

I have been a research scientist at [NAVER AI Lab](https://github.com/naver-ai) for 3.5 years. I received my PhD in computer vision and machine learning at [Max-Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning) in 2018, under the supervision of [Bernt Schiele](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/bernt-schiele) and [Mario Fritz](https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/). My PhD thesis focused on the privacy and security implications of CV and ML ([link](https://publikationen.sulb.uni-saarland.de/handle/20.500.11880/27146)). I received the Master of Mathematics with [Distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos) in 2014 and Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics as a [Wrangler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangler_(University_of_Cambridge)) in 2013, both from the University of Cambridge.

I have started compiling the [principles for life and research](https://github.com/coallaoh/Principles).
